# SkyStone-master
 
ArchiTechs Team RO028 

This repositiory is structured after the Gitflow model(https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
This branch is only for versions of code which actually work.
For any new features branch of dev. After the feature is finished and tested, merge it into dev. 
When we have enough changes on dev, we merge it with release for futher testing, and then merge it with master.
In the unfortunate case there are bugs on master, we branch it off to hotfix, fix it and merge it back.
